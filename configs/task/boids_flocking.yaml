  description: |
    Optimize the Boids flocking simulation. The goal is to evolve the separation,
    alignment, and cohesion behaviors to:
    1. Minimize collisions between boids
    2. Maintain tight grouping (cohesion)
    3. Achieve good velocity alignment

    The simulation runs for 1000 steps with 50 boids. Improve the scoring function,
    behavior weights, and physics parameters to achieve a higher combined score.

    You are an expert in emergent behavior simulation and evolutionary algorithms.
    Optimize the Boids flocking simulation to achieve:
    1. Minimize collisions between boids (separation)
    2. Maintain tight grouping (cohesion)
    3. Achieve good velocity alignment

    The simulation runs 1000 steps with 50 boids. You can edit multiple files:
    - main.py: Entry point and configuration
    - boid.py: Individual boid behavior
    - simulation.py: Simulation loop and physics
    - render.py: Visualization (optional)

    Focus on tuning behavior weights, perception radius, and force calculations.
